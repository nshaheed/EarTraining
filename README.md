EarTraining
===========

This is a rudimentary ear training app based in the HTML5 canvas, and created with blank-canvas (https://github.com/ku-fpg/blank-canvas).

It allows for melodic interval ear training with white-key notes in the range of D4-G5 with an interval span from a unison to an octave, and all chromatic intervals in between.  

Guessing the interval can be done either using the buttons below the staff or by clicking on the staff itself to guess a note.
